# History of .NET and C#
- C# language gradually increased in its functionality along with Visual studio. Each update was step that was much needed for developer to function efficiently
- .NET is open source developer platform that utilize different language.
- .net framework is a website servicee and xamarine or mono is for mobile
- .Net Core is cross platform that helps developer to build device cloud and IoT application.
- To Create a simple demo, you can type in `dotnet new console
dotnet run` in command line which will then run hello world application.

From this I've learne that C# wasn't a blink of a day developed application rather Microsoft took time to build it to its perfection. Also, learned that unlike Javascript, c# alone can't create website rather you need tool like .net framework to create a website and also other tools build in .Net helps to create cool applications.
