# Tooling 
- dotNet is free, cross platform open source developer tool that is created to connect multiple library and language
- `NuGet` is a package manager built specifically for .Net that contains over 90,000 packages.
- Manage code is just code that are executed by run time that is managed by CLR. C# is one of the managed code that CLR manages memories, security boundaries and type safety.
- In visual studio naming different namespace has to be uniform across the application otherwise, it gives error. This can easily be fixed by right clickin the main solution or click on wiggly line with light bulb to fix it.
- Debugging is a tool that can be used to see what and how many iteration can be run before condition is met also. You can add in condition on top of debugging tool to see when it meet your given condition.

From this reading and videos, I learned that C# is more managed language that ease the burden on developer to not worry about memory management, security controls and type safety. I also learn few good tools to use to debug my application by watching videos, like debugging tools. Another cool feature that CLR is that it makes cross between different languages possble.
