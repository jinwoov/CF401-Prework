# Class

- class is like blueprint
- like building a house and then you can build a house using that blue print
- IE: person 
    - field: name, age, haspet
    - method: to update the fields
    - method is like blue print
    - after the making a class then you can make object using that blue print. Kind of like constructor
- Access modifier can be put infront of class, or object and method
    - public, private, protected
    - can gain a access how to acces the piece of blueprint.
    - if public any classes can use it, whereas private is only for that class and if its protected, it can be access by that class and derivative of that class
- scope is {} that is belonged to that group
- if its not going to return anything then write `void`
- if you want to return datatype declare it front of function name either being int, bool, string
```
public int calc(int x, int y)

```
