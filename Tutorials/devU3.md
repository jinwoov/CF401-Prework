- dotnet framework is class library. Library of code to common source of code. IE. math, dates, transiting information across network.
- runtime: Common language runtime. Protected bubble that take care of low level detail.
    - provides that protection to end user and as a developer can't do anything due to CLR
- `Readline` is waiting for the input from the user 
- to comment out is to put '//'
  
- this a code block and has name Main
```
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
```

`class Program` is class or container and its related 
`namespace` a way to organize the code
